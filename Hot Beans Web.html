            <p style="margin-right: 16px;">Our mission here at Hot Beans Web is to make websites more accessible to people who have disabilities. We understand that around 63&#37 of the total population on our planet has some sort of disability that is restricting them to use everyday websites we take for granted for example Techytech. We have partnered with them and their engineers to make sure that our future is more accessible to everyone. As we believe making a world more accessible to everyone is the Golden King. </p>

        <h1>Trainee Dev, Trixie Baker</h1>
        <p>Trixie was born in the United States where she attended  Alabama State University. But unfortunately, in her 3rd year attending school she had to drop out. As the cost of the University was too much to handle. So, she decided to move to the UK where she met David. She asked him if she could work with him as she had no job. David kindly gave her a position as a Trainee Developer here at Hot Beans Web. Where she has really enjoyed collaborating with others on the team in designing websites for different clients. </p>
